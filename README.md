## Overview

This repository contains our submission for the **Agentic AI Scheduling Assistant Hackathon** organized by AMD at IIT Bombay. The challenge was to build an AI-powered assistant capable of autonomously managing scheduling tasks â€” including understanding user requests, coordinating with calendars, and proposing optimal meeting times with minimal human input.

## Why Agentic AI?

Traditional scheduling tools require a lot of back-and-forth or predefined rules. Our solution uses Agentic AI principles to build an assistant that:

- Understands natural language input (e.g., "Schedule a meeting next Thursday at 2 PM")
- Resolves calendar conflicts and adjusts for time zones
- Learns preferences over time
- Acts autonomously to handle changes, send reminders, and follow up

## Features

- Autonomous meeting coordination with minimal user input  
- Integration with Google Calendar API  
- Natural language processing via LLMs (DeepSeek 7B, LLaMA 3.1)  
- vLLM for high-performance inference on MI300 GPUs  
- JSON-based input/output for seamless system integration  

## Setup Instructions

### Clone and prepare the environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AMD-AI-HACKATHON/AI-Scheduling-Assistant.git
cp -r AI-Scheduling-Assistant/* ./
```

### MI300 GPU Setup

Follow the MI300 setup instructions as shown in the provided image:

### Calendar Event Extraction

Google Calendar events are extracted using authentication tokens provided during the hackathon. The notebook includes:

- Authentication flow  
- API requests to fetch events  
- Data transformation into clean JSON structure  

Refer to the notebook: [`Calendar_Event_Extraction.ipynb`](https://github.com/AMD-AI-HACKATHON/AI-Scheduling-Assistant/blob/main/Calendar_Event_Extraction.ipynb)

## Running the vLLM Server

### DeepSeek LLM 7B Chat

```bash
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 vllm serve /home/user/Models/deepseek-ai/deepseek-llm-7b-chat \
  --gpu-memory-utilization 0.9 \
  --swap-space 16 \
  --disable-log-requests \
  --dtype float16 \
  --max-model-len 2048 \
  --tensor-parallel-size 1 \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 3000
```

### Meta LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct

```bash
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 vllm serve /home/user/Models/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \
  --gpu-memory-utilization 0.3 \
  --swap-space 16 \
  --disable-log-requests \
  --dtype float16 \
  --max-model-len 2048 \
  --tensor-parallel-size 1 \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 4000
```

## AI Agent Design

Our AI agent is designed to parse natural language emails and extract structured scheduling information. It uses LLM prompts with clear instructions to extract:

- Participants' emails  
- Meeting duration  
- Time constraints  

### Sample Agent Snippet

```python
class AI_AGENT:
    def __init__(self, client, MODEL_PATH):
        self.base_url = BASE_URL
        self.model_path = MODEL_PATH

    def parse_email(self, email_text):
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model=self.model_path,
            temperature=0.0,
            messages=[{
                "role": "user",
                "content": f"""
                You are an AI scheduling agent. Extract:
                - Email IDs of participants
                - Meeting duration in minutes
                - Time constraints (e.g., next week)

                Format the output strictly as JSON.
                Email: {email_text}
                """
            }]
        )
        return json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Submission Guide

Final submission should be made by executing the following function in the submission notebook:

```python
def your_meeting_assistant(input_json):
    # your implementation
    return {
        "processed": True,
        "output": {...}
    }
```

## Evaluation Criteria

- Accuracy of final output JSON  
- Response time (latency)  
- Code readability and repo structure  
- Creativity in design and approach  
- End-to-end working system
